The Cyber Garage Portable Runtime (CGPR) is an open-source, cross-platform runtime library designed to provide a consistent and portable interface for C programming. CGPR aims to simplify the development of C applications by offering a set of utilities and abstractions that work seamlessly across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and various Unix-like systems.

## Key Features

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensures that applications built with CGPR can run on multiple operating systems without modification.
C99 Support: Leverages modern C99 features for improved code readability and maintainability.

- Utility Functions: Provides a collection of commonly used functions and data types, such as boolean types, byte definitions, and more.
Modular Design: Allows developers to include only the components they need, reducing bloat and improving performance.
Usage

- CGPR is ideal for developers looking to create portable C applications that require a consistent runtime environment across different platforms. By abstracting away platform-specific details, CGPR enables developers to focus on the core functionality of their applications.
